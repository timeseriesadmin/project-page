description = "Time Series Admin is a tool built primarily for developers and administrators who need a simple user interface for interacting with InfluxDB databases. A general knowledge about InfluxQL is required to use Time Series Admin properly, but for those who just want to browse through the structure of a database, there is Explorer panel. One of the most useful features in everyday work is the query history panel which remembers last 30 queries. Time Series Admin is built as an alternative to Chronograf and deprecated Influx Admin UI.<br/><br/>Go ahead and browse through the [Showcase](/#showcase) section to find out more."
